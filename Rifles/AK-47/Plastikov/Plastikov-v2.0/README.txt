### 3D Printable AKM-Pattern Receiver

----v2.0 Update----

MOST IMPORTANTLY:
The documentation folder has a through tutorial. Read it completely for info on how to build, how to troubleshoot, etc.
While the documentation is lengthy, don't mistake the overall process for being complex - the documentation is meant to aid everyone from newbies to experienced folks in putting an AK together.

Printing Options/Settings:

     - For filament, PLA (Optionally Nylon [645 is tested good], PETG).  Materials with better heat resistance than PLA will let you dump more mags before needing to let the gun cool.
     - A printer capable of printing PLA (or the plastic you choose to use).  The Creality Ender 3 is capable.
		
### Print Settings

     - Orientations
	     Note that the included STLs are scaled and oriented correctly!
	 
         - Print rear receiver with the angled face flat to the bed.
         - Print the front receiver with the angeld face flat to the bed.
	 - Print the top covers on their rear face (where the square hole is).
	 - Print the anti-rotation device for carbine stocks on it's forward face.
	
	 - Print Settings
		 If you print in eSun PLA+, follow these settings.  Failure to print hot enough will end poorly.
		 
		 - Nozzle Temp             - 230C
		 - Bed Temp                - 60C
		 - Brim                    - ON
		 - Supports                - Full - 45-deg threshold
		 - Layer Height            - 0.15mm
		 - Shells (aka perimeters) - 4 inner/outer (this may not be necessary, but works well for me)
		 - Bed prep                - Gluestick, optionally on top of Kapton Tape.
		 - Infill		   - 100%

	- No matter what material you print it, it is important that you set your SUPPORT THRESHOLD to 45deg.  The receiver doesn't need supports underath the entire thing, assuming you are using a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.15mm layer height.
