I wouldn't release it unless I know it works. So heres a short clip of me testing my own design. I fired 150 rounds with the Lower. No issues except a doublefeed malfunction on round 120ish, caused by improper loading of the magazine. User error, not the lower.


Enjoy your freedoms, and have fun printing!
