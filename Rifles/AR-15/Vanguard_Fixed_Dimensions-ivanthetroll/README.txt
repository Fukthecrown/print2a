This is an update to the Warfairy Vanguard lower done by Ivanthetroll.

This lower, like many others, have all sorts of dimensions for pinholes and the like off-spec.  I took the time to fix those dimensions I found wrong, plus clean up a few other parts of the model itself.

As a result, it is much easier to assemble this lower once it is printed - less hand-fitting, less need to junk a part if it warps slightly.

I've test printed this lower in PLA and PETG to ensure the updated dimensions actually help make assembly easier, in both cases it did.

I used a default print profile for PETG, printed PLA at 230C/55C.  I recommend 100% infill.  Set support threshold angle to 45degrees.

The STL provided is scaled and oriented properly already.

It's important to be aware this lower is set up for carbine buffer tubes - a rifle tube would not screw in correctly/fully.

As with all printed AR15 lowers, you will have to bring holes up to their final size with a drill bit, but this lower shouldn't require any force-matching of pin holes or introduce any unneessarily tight-fit parts.  The upper will be snug on the lower, but shouldn't have to be forced into place.


*Note* - one part AR15 lowers, like this one, greatly benefit from fiberglass heat-welding on the buffer tower.  I recommend doing this to increase the lifespan and strength of the lower.

For the curious, here's the changelog as I remember it:

Magwell moved rearward into proper posistion
Bolt-hold open slot, plunger/spring hole moved forward into proper posistion
Rear takedown pin hole location corrected
Hammer pin hole location corrected
Trigger pin hole location corrected
Buffer tower to front takedown pin corrected
Mag slot height corrected
Mag slot lenght corrected
Mag catch arm hole posistion corrected
Safety hole locatiation corrected
Buffer tower threads re-modeled so that they don't crash when imported as a .step
