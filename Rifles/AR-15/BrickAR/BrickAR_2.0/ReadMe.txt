Here's the newest model of the BrickAR with a few improvements:

Changed the front takedown from a standard captive takedown pin to a simple hole for a 1/4" bolt, clevis pin, or quick release pin. 
The lower is just over 40mm wide at that point, so you'll need an appropriate lenght bolt or pin. 
The rear takedown still uses a standard AR-15 takedown pin, although enhanced ones would be preferable.

Integrated a Magpul-style trigger guard since I was constantly having issues breaking the legs for that while installing the roll pin. 

Added about another millimeter of thickness to the lugs for the bolt catch pin (another somewhat weak point when installing the roll pin).


Enjoy, and as always I welcome feedback.
