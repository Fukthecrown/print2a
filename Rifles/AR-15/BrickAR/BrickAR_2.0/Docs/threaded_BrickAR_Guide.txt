it is highly recommended to print the test file first for the buffer tower in whatever profile and filament you will be priting the lower in 
to make sure your settings are proper. if fitment is too loose bump flow by 5 and try the test again. also do not change orientation of the
test file as it is in the exact orientation you will be printing the lower in to reduce margin for error.
