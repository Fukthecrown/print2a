The Nautilus-TT
A 3D printable Tokarev frame in 7.62x25 (with tactical rails) and a 1913/AR adapter.

This project is the result of scouring the internet for parts and reference dimensions, as well as CAD reference provided by Ivan the Troll. Months of designing, printing, and testing have finally yielded a fiunctioning model. Parts for this pistol are widely available throughout most of the world. It is also a straightforward build, so this may be the most globally accessable printed pistol yet.

##Parts
Complete slide assembly without rear sight
Hammer assembly
Trigger and trigger spring
Magazine catch
Slide release
Paper clip and scrap plastic or tape
2x #6 or m4 x 30 screws for brace adapter

##Print Instructions - Frame & Adapter
Orientation - Magwell to bed
Material - PLA+ recomended. Several have been printed in PLA. YMMV
Walls/Top/Bottom - 5
Infill 80-99%
Support - Everywhere (I recomend tree supports if possible. Normal supports are increadibly difficult to remove from the rear tube.)

##Post Processing
After removing supports, take care in cleaning out the trigger spring notch (rear bottom of magwell) as well as the trigger track. The cleaner these areas are, the better the trigger pull will be. Sand the feed ramp smooth to improve feeding.
Slide release retainer - Bend a straightened paperclip in half. Bend end up 10 mm. Bend other side up with 21 mm in between. Cut off excess. Coat end in plastic or another material to protect slide release. Push the retainer into its recess with something hot to melt it into place (refer to drawing in Renders).

##Brace adapter
AR - fits threaded AR buffer tube
BSPT - fits 3/4 british standard threaded pipe
NPT - fits 3/4 standard American threaded pipe
Threaded plastic pipe is commonly found for irrigation. Reduce size of printed brace in slicer to fit snugly if pipe is used.
