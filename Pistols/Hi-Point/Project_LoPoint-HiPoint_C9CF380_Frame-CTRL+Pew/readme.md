CTRLPew & Deterrence Dispersed Presents
The Lopoint
A 3D printable HiPoint C9/C380 frame (with tactical rail) and a replacement picatinny railed rear sight block.

This project is the culmination of 3 months of CAD and hours of collaboration with an amazing testing team. The result being a meme worthy firearm that can be had for an almost disposable price. With parts kits on the market for $30-$80 and $3 in material costs this is probably the most cost effective kit for people to start with in the gun printing space. And when youre done its a good laugh.
