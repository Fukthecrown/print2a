The Big-Point
By: Atmac

Hello, thank you for downloading the Big-Point, your continued support is greatly appreciated.

The Big-Point is the first printable Pistol frame able to withstand the 45. acp cartridge, 
it uses either a hi point JCP (.40sw) or JHP (.45 acp) parts kit. 

A 16-gage finishing nail will also be needed for the sear pivot, as well as something to cut it down with
You will see a hole for it on the right side of the frame where all the action parts go, just press it in.

For assembly, follow this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7ydeVsdmzg by AshburnArmorer.

As for printing, supports everywhere are needed, but most of them will only be generated over the bed.

DO NOT PRINT UPSIDE DOWN. unless you hate yourself and want to have trouble cleaning supports out of all
the little holes.

Because of the straight blowback nature of Hi-points, most common filaments can be used, though eSun 
PLA+ is recommended.

for the sight raiser, supports over bed only are suitable, and again, any common filaments will work, 
But eSun PLA+ is recommended

Now get printing!
