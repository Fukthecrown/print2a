* Complete G26 Parts Kit
* P80 Rails

#### Print Settings
* Print in PLA or ABS
* Infill: 99% infill
* Orientation: Print frame upside down

Note: PLA will not stand up to hot environments. The gun itself will not hold enough heat to hurt the frame but a PLA frame sitting in a hot car will damage it.

##### Post Print Finishing of Frame
Refer to the instruction videos above. In general, it is the same process as putting a normal Glock together but with the required rails. The only part that really needs hand fitting is the locking block. The locking block needs to be tight, so it may take a bit to get situated correctly. 

#### 4. Assembly Notes
Important items to note about assembly are in the instructional videos. Below are some additional notes:

* Holes must be drilled to size. Do not try to hammer the pins in. They should go in easy.
* If your front rail block is loose, consider a little JB weld or epoxy on the sides and front to steady it. A loose front rail can cause issues.
* If the locking block pin holes do not line up, do not try and force the pins through.
* Yes, the rear rails are necessary; do not fire the gun without them. 
* Check your rail height by pressing down on the barrel when the gun is in battery. It should depress some but should not unlock the action. If the action unlocks, your rails are way too high. Watch the machining video for more information.

General Assembly: 
* Add front rail section
* Add locking block
* Add slide lock
* Add trigger bar/housing assembly
* Remove trigger bar/housing assembly once fitment is verified
* Screw in rear rails
* Reinstall trigger assembly
* Pin in the locking block, trigger assembly, and slide stop
* Ensure the rails are flat/on the same plane using a straight edge
* Ensure fitment of the slide with barrel and spring removed
* Ensure fitment and function of the pistol with barrel and spring installed
* Function test! Function test! Function test! Rack that slide real hard.
