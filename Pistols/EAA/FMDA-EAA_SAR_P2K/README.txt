#### Description 
This is a 3D Printable EAA SAR P2K Frame for 9mm parts kits.

#### Tools and Parts List
Below is a list of tools, parts and materials you should need to complete this project.

##### Off the shelf Glock parts:
* Complete EAA SAR P2K upper (from EveryGunPart, Gunbroker, etc)
* Complete EAA SAR P2K lower parts kit (from EveryGunPart, Gunbroker, etc)


##### Print Settings
For a light duty/workable frames:
* Material: eSun PLA+
* Print Temp: 235 C
* Bed Temp: 60 C
* Bed Prep: Wipe clean, apply a thick layer of Elmer’s glue stick. Kapton tape is recommended since this frame will really stick to the bed tight if you use the STL with the raft.
* Infill: 100%, Rectilinear Fill
* Enclosure: None
* Orientation: not super critical but using the STL with the raft will result in far less warp. Warp is the enemy of this project.
* Supports: full, hexagonal infill, sheathing on infill optional but recommended if your slicer supports it.

Remember that PLA will not stand up to hot environments. While the gun itself won’t hold enough heat to hurt the frame (I dumped 50 rounds as quick as I could load them without issue), having this frame sit in a hot car would damage it.

For a heavy duty/durable frames:
* Material: Zytel or Glass filled Zytel
* Print Temp: 287 C
* Bed Temp: 100 C
* Bed Prep: Wipe clean, apply a thick layer of Elmer’s glue stick. Kapton tape is recommended since this frame will really stick to the bed tight if you use the STL with the raft.
* Infill: 100%, Rectilinear Fill
* Enclosure: None needed, but it will not hurt if you use one.
* Orientation: not super critical but using the STL with the raft will result in far less warp. Warp is the enemy of this project.

If you use glass filled Zytel, you may need to coat the outside of the frame with fiberglass resin because the glass fill is very abrasive. Either Zytel frame will stand up to excessive amounts of abuse. Boiling the Zytel frame in water after printing will help layer adhesion without warping the part.

#### Assembly 
Assembles like a standard EAA Witness.

* Holes must be drilled to size. Don’t try and hammer the pins in. They should go in easy.
* If the locking block pin holes don’t line up, don’t try and force the pins through.
