PolyPlinker Release V0.9

I'm dubbing this version 0.9. Its not quite at the point I would be happy to call it 1.0, but as I haven't
had the time or resources to really work on it lately I wanted to open it up to the community so it doesn't
dissappear.

DISCLAIMER:
My model includes the WarFairy Charon Lower, I did not create this, I simply designed my upper to work with
it and made some *very* small changes I thought worked well for this project.

Components:
Standard AR-15 FCG (it does not use the bolt catch)
A 1/4" bolt/rod/etc to act as takedown pins
M5 cap screw for the charging handle
Standard buffer spring (?)
Lots of glue
CMMG .22lr barrel and BCG -OR- Any .223 barrel and a CMMG conversion BCG
Better Mag Adapter used in conjunction with M&P15-22 mags is reccomended but CMMG mags will work
(If someone wants to make a printable version of the BMA that would be awesome for this project!)

Printing Notes:
My version is printed from PETG, however I believe PLA+ would also work but I cannnot say for certain.

I printed all the components individually except for the magwell. I found printing the 3 magwell components
as one single part resulted in a significantly better magwell fit

Print the Upper vertically with the barrel end on the bed

Other Notes
I think the BCG needs some preload to make sure it stays engaged with the barrel, hence the need for the
buffer spring. This is what I have not been able to test so that is still a theory

Happy Plinking!
