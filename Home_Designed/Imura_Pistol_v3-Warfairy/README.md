3.0

#### Author
Warfairy et al.


#### Changelog v3.0
* Firing Pin Channel offset changed to allow actual firing instead of skipping off the bottom edge of the .22LR Casing. Striker, Frame and Cylinder cap have been changed to reflect new position of firing pin. 
* Banding system reworked (Again.) for more reliable rebound and striking. Single band now handles rebound while multiple bands provide primary drive for striker. Both sets of bands now attach at the same point to simplify frame STL Geometry. 
* These changes brought to you by Caffeine, Nicotine, and the FOSSCAD Group.

#### Description

This pistol has been a long time in the making. Version one was so disappointing in so many ways that version two was created before version one was ever even tested. It has been the single most frustrating design I have ever worked on and is the culmination of hundreds of redesigns, sleepless nights, multiple pounds of coffee and a bottomless supply of nicotine. Each and every part has been changed in some way from version one, each improved in one form or another. This thing has taught me more about the design software and design work in general than I thought possible, and I am glad to bring it to you now. She's my favorite design so far, and I truly hope that you enjoy shooting her as much as I did bringing her to life.

####Instructions

1 Press Barrel Liner into Barrel from rear. Barrel liner should flush against forward face of the cylinder cup integral to part, ending at the start of the printed rifling. Do NOT allow barrel to flex or bend during insertion, as any kink in the Barrel Liner will cause catastrophic failure of the firearm.

2 Press 8x Chamber Liners into Cylinder. Chamber Liners should flush against rear face of the cylinder. Do not allow Chamber Liners to flex or bend during insertion, as any kink in the Chamber Liners will make that chamber impossible to load.

3 Place Steel Weight into both halves of Striker (Striker_Right and Striker_Left). Epoxy into place. 

4 Apply small amount of Epoxy to Firing Pin Channel of both halves of striker and place Firing Pin into the channel, ensuring the pin is fully seated against rear face of firing pin channel. Apply adhesive or solvent to inside faces of striker around the weights and firing pin. Bind two halves of striker together, taking extreme care to square the two parts. Any misalignment will prevent function of the firearm. 

5 Place open hole of Forward_Trigger_Bar onto the forward peg of Trigger. Top face (the one with the advancement peg) should form a straight face with the top of the trigger, and the sides should be coplanar.

6 Place Sear onto cutout on top of Trigger. Holes in the two should align and the Sear tab should face up from the trigger. Place Trigger_Pin through the holes of the Sear and Trigger such that it aligns with the integrated cam on the Sear.

7 Slide Trigger Assembly into Barrel from rear. Advancing Peg of Forward_Trigger_Bar will go into slot at the bottom of the chamber cup, between  the hinges on either side. The interface of Forward_Trigger_Bar and Trigger should be coradial with the hinges on either side.

8 Place Frame_Pins into hinges on either side of Barrel

9 Place Barrel and Trigger assembly onto Frame_Right. Frame_Pin on right side of barrel should slide into sister hinge of Frame_Right. Ensure Peg on right side of Sear and Trigger_Pin align into angled groove in Frame_Right.

10 Place Release_Lever_Right into hole at top of the Frame such that the Keyed face faces forward. Place one rubber band around frame-facing peg on inside face of Release_Lever_Right. Press Latch onto Release_Lever_Right such that keyed faces align. Keyed peg of Release_Lever_Right will only fill 1/2 of the through hole in Latch.

11 Place Sear_Flapper into hinge at rear of the Striker Assembly. Large block should be on the bottom and hooked face should be on top. Then press Flapper_Pin through the aligned holes. Place one rubber band around hooked faces of Striker Aseembly and Sear_Flapper. This will provide trigger reset. Ensure that Sear_Flapper moves forward and snaps back to vertical when borne upon from the rear.

12 Place Striker Assembly into Recess of Frame_Right. Use a piece of string looped through rubber band to draw the band through the matching holes at bottom of Striker and middle of Frame half. Place rubber band around retaining peg on outside of frame and pull excess slack through striker.

13 Place Rubber band around Retaining peg behind trigger and thread through frame hole behind trigger, pulling excess slack through using a piece of string looped through the rubber band.

14 Thread two pieces of string through matching holes in Frame_Left and align pegs on inside face of Frame_Left with the recesses on Frame_Right. Press Frame_Right into place on Frame_Left, taking care to keep Trigger_Pin and Sear aligned with angled groove of both frame halves. Once pegs of Frame_Left are starting to enter recesses of Frame_Right, pull through slack of both rubber bands and secure around their respective retaining pegs. Once rubber bands are in place, press frame halves together.

15 Test function. Place finger of non firing hand over firing pin opening on forward face of frame and pull trigger. You should feel a sharp tap by the firing pin. If no tap is felt, stop, disassemble, check fit of all parts, retry. Striker should move freely through opening in frame, with no snags or significant friction. Sear should engage Sear_Flapper when trigger is pulled and disengage when sear drops to low point of the angled groove on frame.

16 If function test is good, Press Release_Lever_Left partially into remaining hole at top of frame, aligning the keyed faces of Latch and Release_Lever_Left. Pull slack of rubber band from step 10 and loop over top of frame into the small groove on top, then around the inward facing peg of Release_Lever_Left. Press Release_Lever_Left fully into place, allowing rubber band to bear on pegs of both Release_Lever halves to complete Latch Assembly.

17 Place remaining two Steel Weights into recess of barrel on left side and Epoxy into place. Use Barrel_Weight_Cap to finish the Barrel Assembly.

18 Open firearm by pressing either Release Lever. Barrel should drop down, allowing the loading of a cylinder. Place unloaded Cylinder with Cylinder_Cap in place onto the spindle in the center of the Cylinder Cup. Close firearm and cycle check. Pull trigger 8x times. cylinder should advance without issue through all 16x positions, with Striker drawing and releasing on each pull, and cylinder advancing to safe position on each release.

19 The firearm is now ready for operation. If desired, the operator may bind the two halves of the frame together with Acetone, Epoxy, Cement, or other desired item.
