DISCLAIMER: 

Abide by all local/federal laws and regulations before building the WTF-9. You are liable for any damage or injury to
yourself, others, and/or any property that may result if you choose to build this firearm. You are liable for any violations of
law and/or any legal issues that may arise due to the construction of this firearm.

* What is the WTF-9?

The WTF-9 is a semi-automatic, partially 3D-printed and partially machined firearm. It is constructed using 3D printed
components, easily-obtainable hardware store fasteners, a DIY-style steel bolt, as well as a few firearm components
(Glock mag/barrel, AK-47 recoil spring, and AR-15 FCG). 

It is the evolution of its predecessor, the AP-9, featuring major changes such as an improved bolt design and the elimination
of the buffertube. The WTF-9 is a modular platform that comes with several accessories, such as multiple folding stocks
and foregrips, and has a dedicated community continually designing more upgrades and accessories.

It comes in two variants, the WTF-9MV (Mussy Variant) and the WTF-9H (Hillbilly), both of which are compatible with
the variety of accessories currently available and those still in development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* What are the differences between the WTF-9MV (Mussy Variant) and the WTF-9H (Hillbilly) versions?

The WTF-9H is compatible with shorter length barrels, such as Glock 26 barrels that will not fit the WTF-9MV model
properly, since it is designed to use Glock-17 length barrels and longer.

The WTF-9H is essentially a lighter version with fewer components, it includes a shorter barrel retainer while the
WTF-9MV has a longer barrel retainer that doubles as a handguard, while also housing the longer barrel and charging
handle found on the WTF-9MV.

The lower receivers are interchangeable between the WTF-9MV and the WTF-9H variants.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Can I use any other (non-Glock) barrels with the WTF-9 variants?

The community is currently working on making the WTF-9 variants compatible with electrochemically-machined barrels,
for regions of the world where Glock barrels may be difficult to obtain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Can I use any other fire control groups?

The community is also currently working on making the WTF-9 variants compatible with airsoft style fire control groups,
but as of right now, the AR15 fire control group will be needed to build the WTF-9 variants.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Are there any customized parts available for the variants?

There is a community developed designs folder hosted on the WTF-9 keybase team, including several customized models
of the lower receivers.
