WTF-9: Bolt Spin Jig  - yaus

Notes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This is an initial release, please try using this jig out and report your feedback to improve the design
- This is intended to be a affordable way to make the bolt at home (aside from welding) using inexpensive parts
and household tools


Printed Parts List:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) Bearing arms
(1) Base
(1) Chuck

Non-printed Parts List:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Common corded/cordless drill, more power helps but should be fine with weaker drills, just slower

(1) donor hex bit tip holder for drills
	- commonly included with packs of screws
	- example:

(2) Ball Bearing - 3/4" Shaft Diameter
	- https://www.mcmaster.com/60355K507

(2) 3mm Metal pins of some sort
	- can be a 3mm bolt/screw, imperial equivalent, or a 3mm steel bar/rod, etc.
	- only to retain the bearing arms from prying out of the base plate


(4) screws/bolts to secure base to a flat platform (optional, vise may work)


Assembly and Use:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Use an epoxy or similar adhesive to secure the donor hex bit holder into the spin jig chuck, make sure its
fully seated and wait for it to fully cure before use

2) Insert 3/4" bearings into the bearing arms, make sure they are fully seated, if the fit is loose, maybe wrap
some thread sealer tape around the bearing, etc.

3) Insert the 3/4" bar stock after dimensions have been drawn on it (i.e. the lengths of areas that will be taken down),
into the bearing arms as in the pictures

4) Slot in the bearing arms into the base until they are flush with the bottom side, attach 3mm pins through the holes to secure the parts, secure the base to a platform or put it in a vise.

5) Align the bearing arms with the marks on the bolt where the diameter of the bolt is not cut into (i.e. the unmachined section of the bolt). refer to pictures for help with alignment here

6) Press the chuck onto the raw stock (the short end first), spin the chuck using a drill, use an angle grinder to slowly grind away the longer machined section to 16.3mm or slightly narrower in diameter.

7) Remove the chuck, wrap some tape (or maybe will design a spacer here...) around the turned down section that was
just completed, and attach the chuck to that side, spin it with the drill and grind down the other side as close to spec
as possible.

8) Remove ground bolt from the spin jig and double check dimensions, sand/grind more as necessary if parts are not fitting
perfectly.
