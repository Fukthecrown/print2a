QCB1 M1 "Flanders"

Caliber: 22LR, 22 Short

Loading: Subsonics, Standard Velocity

Action: Single Action

Capacity: 1 Cartridge

Summary:


The QCB1 (Quick Change Barrel) "Flanders" is designed around a keyed barrel system, allowing quick barrel changes without the need for 
firearm dissasembly. Different "Configurations" allow for different use cases; ie a snub nose config for a compact, concealable, weapon, 
or a extended config for driving rounds at a higher velocity for varmint removal.

Inserting and twisting clockwise 90Â° locks the barrel in place, preventing the barrel from ejection due to firing. The barrel is 
designed with flats on it's sides; should the barrel prove difficult to remove after firing, an adjustable wrench can engage said flats, 
and ease in removal if required.


Hardware Required:

*0.5x5x20mm - 0.5x5x25mm Spring (For Trigger Spring)

*M4x18 - M4x20 Screws

*2.77mm Shank Finishing Nail (Cut for Firing Pin)


Why the Name?

Just like how Homer from the "Simpsons" unquestionably hates Flanders, the government unquestionably continues gun control
policies, blindly hating firearms (despite needing them for their guards) and their owners. While continuing to persue stricter gun 
control, it's been found to be difficult to nearly impossible to stop the spread and manufacture of 3D printed firearms, just like 
amusingly, Flanders himself finds it nearly impossible to not be a nice guy. Also, the name is fun to say....

Notes: 

*While the trigger spring can easily be bought online through Amazon, or other retailers, I found that many ballpoint pens 
have the same spring, such as the Staples Aura .7, and the Pentel Energel .7 retractable pens.

*M4 screws can be bought in plastic varieties (or 3D printed), should you wish for the firearm to be undetectable. If the 
user wishes to comply with the Undetectable Firearms Act, metal screws can be used in addition to filling the hollow grip 
with metal.
