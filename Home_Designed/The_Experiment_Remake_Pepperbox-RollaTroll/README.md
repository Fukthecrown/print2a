# The Experiment Remake Pepperbox

#### Description
This a Pepperbox version of the Experiment Remake. 

#### Instructions
It's assembled in much the same way. However, you WILL have to print the parts for the Pepperbox. The only differences between the Assembly methods are on the Barrels part.

Do not put the Barrel and Barrel Shaft on until you have both the Front Block and Trigger Guard on. Once ready, you should put glue in the appropriate hole in the Front Block, then drop the Barrel into place and fit the Barrel Shaft in through the front hole of the Trigger Guard and fit it into the glued hole of the Front Block. Make sure the end with a hole is not the end that goes into the Front Block!

You may then put glue in the hole for the nut, this should be in the end of the Barrel Shaft. Make sure it is FULLY dry before you put the Barrel Shaft Cap on. You could also glue that in too, if you wanted. You may then screw the two pieces together until the Barrel will still turn properly.

The Lock should be glued into the Front Block so that it will fit into the Barrel and keep it from turning without effort.

Once ALL glue is FULLY dried, you may try shooting it from a distance, e.g. clamp and string.

#### DISCLAIMER
I take no responsibility of any kind for any legal issues, damage, injury or death that may occur due to use of or production of this design. It is untested and is by NO means guaranteed to function. Use common sense and be careful.

#### NOTES
Looking back several months after designing it, I now realize that many major parts would be near impossible to print (Body, Hammer Slide, Front Block, Trigger Guard, etc.). I may fix some of these problems at some point, but it may be awhile.
