Here is the new WTF-9 Hillbilly. it is the original test design. Nothing fancy just "meat and potatoes". Its light and the barrel will run a little cooler because its completely open to the atmosphere. Good for shorter barrels. It will accept all WTF-9 accessories. You can use the ap9 lower or the wtf-9 lower by Mussy designs. Take it to the range and you will be the coolest dude there!


                                                                   Enjoy!
