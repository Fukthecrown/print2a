It is best to file the point of the thumbtack down before you remove it, as the body gives a handle to hold on to or clamp. Make sure you round the tip down to about where it started sloping to a point. To remove the pin from the thumb tack, you could use a wire cutter to clip off unnecessary parts of the plastic casing, then squeeze it with a vice until it starts to crack, then twist with a pair of pliers. Make sure not to bend the pin, or you will have to straighten it later. The pin should have a rib that keeps it from coming out easily, but should also help hold it into the hammer slide.

Once all parts are printed and hardware gathered, you should start with the Trigger Guard and Body. Fit the guard onto the bottom of the body and screw it together, having the vertical side parallel to the front of the body. Before you put the grip on you will need to fit the trigger in and put the Trigger Spring and Trigger  
Spring Cap onto the trigger. You will want to glue the Trigger Spring Cap onto the trigger. You will now need to screw down the trigger guide, just make sure the side that has the overhand is holding in the Trigger Spring. If you do not do this now, you will have to remove the grip later. Once done, you may fit the grip onto the body and line up the 3 holes for the screws, it should sit flush to the trigger guard. The body will be extending forward of the grip. Insert the screws on each side and put the nuts on, tightening it up so it stays rigid.

You may now fit the Hammer Body in; just make sure the slot is open on the top. As you put it on, fit strong rubber bands on both sides in the set out slots. They should be trapped there and hang loose for now. Screw the Hammer Body in, it should be obvious.

Fit the Filled Thumb Tack Pin into the Hammer Slide, then fit that into the Body and put the Short Hammer Slide Pin in the front hole, and do the same with the Long Pin in the back hole. You may want to glue them in if they aren't tight on their own. Make sure the pins are close to even in their alignment. The first pin should sit flush to the sides and the long one should sit 10mm out from each side. Now put the rubber bands on their corresponding pins and make sure they'll stay, loop them around it once if necessary.

You may now fit the barrel into the front slot of the Hammer Body, but don't go shooting yet. If you used any glue in the assembly (which might be wise), then let it dry until it is supposed to be FULLY dry. Once done, you may try to shoot it from afar (e.g. clamp and string). To cock the weapon, pull the Hammer Slide back and down so it fits into the slot set out for it. The quicker you fire it, the better the rubber bands will perform, as they cool down and loose energy when left stretched.

#### DISCLAIMER
 I take no responsibility of any kind for any legal issues, damage, injury or death that may occur due to use of or production of this design. It is untested and is by NO means guaranteed to function. Use common sense and be careful.

NOTES: Looking back several months after designing it, I now realize that many major parts would be near impossible to print (Body, Hammer Slide, Hammer Body, Trigger, etc.). I may fix some of these problems at some point, but it may be awhile.
