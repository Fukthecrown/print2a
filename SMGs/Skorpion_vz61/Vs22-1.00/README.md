#### Version
* 1.0 - FMDA
* v1.00 - nguyenkvvn

This is the VS-22 receiver, based on the VZ-61 Lower Receiver by FreemenDontAsk. It is remixed *specifically* for the Czech Small Arms' .22LR Conversion Kit, as those differ from surplus spec kits just enough to require a revision. Changes include fitment issues for the reciever and magazine.

This revision also includes a 1913 rail option on the top of the reciever, with 1913 brace mounting options.

#### Parts Required 
* Czech Small Arms' [Vz. 61 .22LR Universal Threaded Conversion Kit](https://www.czechpoint-usa.com/22lr-vz-61-universal-threaded-conversion-kit/product)
* AR-15 fire control group
* Vz61 Magazine Release Button, with spring
* VZ61 Bolt Catch Lever, with spring *(optional)*
* Vz61 Ejector, with Ejector Rod *(see alternative notes below)*

#### Printing
* Print at 100% infill with tree supports
* Print at maximum strength with PLA+ (230c @ 45mm/s)
* Print with fire-control group pocket facing up

#### Assembly
Aside from the complete removal of supports, there is no post-processing required.

If you want to save a few dollars, you can use a drill to bore out the ejector rod hole (above the mag release) and snip a 3mm aluminum rod to retain the magazine release.
