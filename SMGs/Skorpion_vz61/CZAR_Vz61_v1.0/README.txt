This is the CZAR Vz61 3D-printable receiver, meant to complete Vz61 parts kits.

The original model was developed by FMDA, reinforcements, tweaking, and updating done by IvanTheTroll.

For help finshing your build, refer to the 'CZAR Vz61 Build Tutorial' pdf found in this download package, as well as the video you can watch and download here: https://lbry.tv/@Ivan's_CAD_Streams:c/Vz61TutorialV1.0:c

For general print settings:

This receiver has been tested to work well in eSun PLA+. In any material similar or superior to PLA+, this receiver should work as well.

**Note that all STL files are oriented and scaled properly, and changing their scale or orientation may result in your parts not fitting/working properly.**
**Note that you will need to drill holes (3mm or 4mm) in the simple tube in order to mate it to the receiver!**


My print settings for PLA+ were as follows:

Nozzle: 0.4mm
Temp: 230/60
Infill: 100% (You can use less infill on the tube/brace adapter and grip if so desired)
Supports: On/full (tree supports are ok)
Cooling fan: 15% normal, 50% on bridges. Off for the first 10 layers.
Bed Adhesion: gluestick or hairspray or both

All other settings can/should be left as default or whatever you know works best with your printing setup.
