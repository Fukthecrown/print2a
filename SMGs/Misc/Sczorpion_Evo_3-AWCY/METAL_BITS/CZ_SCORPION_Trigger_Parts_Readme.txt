Someone who understands CNC machining can look at local or out of state machine job shops that are willing to 
take on the individual components. Some parts, such as the bolt would be easier to be milled on a multiaxis machine,
 while some of the trigger pack components could be made with a laser/waterjet machine and finished out with 
post processing and heat treat. Some compents can be made by hand such as the charging handle, 
which is made from a chopped hex wrench and 3D printed parts.

These parts are currently modeled, however slight adjustments may need to be made to translate it to CAM
Under No circumstances should you attempt to make the parts within this folder out of plastic and you should always verify dimensions
