#      Multiple parts (core parts above) are shared between standard          #
# stock & brace configurations. This guide will note differences between      #
#             the different tailhook & stock end-assemblies.                  #
#                Note that in USA attaching a stock with a                    #
#              shorter-length barrel can violate unjust laws.                 #
#                                                                             #
#                          ## parts for assembly                              #
#                                                                             #
#                              ### core parts                                 #
#    * **endplate hinge pin or screw** (span of 53.5mm w 5mm diameter)        #
#                       * preferred options include:                          #
#      * screw: M5 with 50-53.5mm length (ideally spans whole length)         #
#  * pin: 4mm x 53mm steel rod (McMaster part # 8920K16) - cut to length      #
#                        * less ideal but can work:                           #
# * 3d printed pin 53.5mm included here (not recommended due to low strength) #
#                                                                             #
#    * **cheekrest button pin or screw** (16-20mm length, 3mm diameter)       #
#           * e.g. Coiled Spring Pin (McMaster part # 91612A225)              #
#       * note that protrusion of screwhead or pin may work but can           #
#              partially engage the hinge plate button/spring                 #
# * pin likely will provide better function but will be difficult to remove   #
#                                                                             #
#                                * springs                                    #
#      * **receiver button spring** (protrudes from receiver rear &           #
#                         keeps endplate in place)                            #
# * 0.75 Long, 0.188 OD 0.13 ID Compression Spring (McMaster part # 9657K283) #
# * **cheekrest button spring** (locks/releases stock/brace from endplate)    #
# * 0.75 Long, 0.3 OD, 0.218 ID Compression Spring (stock catch spring)       #
#                        (Mcmaster part # 9657K287)                           #
#        * pen & printer springs might work but may be too narrow             #
#                       or may need to be cut to fit                          #
#  * amazon compression/extension spring kits contain springs that are        #
#         narrower and less forceful than optimal, but will work              #
#           (e.g. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7M36W/)              #
#                                                                             #
#                 ### OEM tailhook adapter specific parts                     #
#               * **brace position pin or screw** (20-24mm)                   #
#                                                                             #

#               * **brace position pin or screw** (20-24mm)                   #
#      * e.g. 3m x 20mm Coiled Spring Pin (McMaster part # 91612A227)         #
#  * a socket M3 20mm screw works (though a flat head or pin is probably      #
#               easier re not having screw head protruding)                   #
# * **tailhook nut** (goes in small tailhook part): 1/4x20 Nylon-Insert nut   #
#                       (McMaster part # 90630A110)                           #
#    * **tailhook end-screw** (secures the 2 tailhook parts together)         #
#      1/4x20 x 1 1/8 Button Head Screw (McMaster part # 92949A835)           #

#                    * for *levered version* also need:                       #
#        * **lever to brace pin** 6mmx30mm or 1/4x1.25in Roll pin             #
#  * **brace lever spring** 1 Long, 0.125 OD, 0.081 ID compression spring     #
#                        (McMaster part # 9657K295)                           #

#                         ### stock specific parts                            #
#          * **lever to stock pin** 6mm x 16mm coiled spring pin              #
#                       (McMaster part # 91612A191)                           #
# * **stock magnet** 10mm OD x 5mm Deep Round Rare Earth Magnet (Optional)    #
#        * **stock lever spring** 3/16 OD x 39/64 Length spring               #
#          (can be found in Homedepot Everbuilt 88 spring pack)               #
#   (for slightly stronger spring cut to length a 3/16 OD .29 WD spring)      #
#                                                                             #
