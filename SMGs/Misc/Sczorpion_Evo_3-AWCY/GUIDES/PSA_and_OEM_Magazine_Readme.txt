#                                Assembly:                                    #
# 1. Ensure all parts are cleaned of supports and print artifacts             #
#    (file mating surfaces a tiny bit if too snug).                           #
# 2. Ream/clean up last round hold open hole on mag body, so that the         #
#    mag follower's last round hold open tab moves freely in it.              #
#    (Optional: lube internals of mag body with dry ptfe lubricant            #
#    to help ensure smooth feeding)                                           #
# 3. Insert mag follower into mag body.                                       #
# 4. Insert spring (jiggle around a tiny bit to ensure it is in position)     #
# 5. Insert lock plate into end of spring sticking out of mag body.           #
# 6. Compress spring with lock plate and slide end plate into its interface   #
#    on the bottom of the mag body.                                           #
# 7. Congrats on the super cheap and very dependable magazine.                #
