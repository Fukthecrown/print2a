## Bill of Materials:
1 Cheek Rest (hard plastic)
1 Brace (soft plastic)
1 Lever (hard plastic)
1 Pin (hard plastic)
### OR
1 M6x10 hex bolt
2 Drilling Jigs (hard plastic)
1 Base (hard plastic)
3 M3x12 roll pins
1 M3x16 roll pin (20 mm pin will work just cut it to length)
1 AR-15 Magazine Catch Spring

## Assembly:
Print the plastic parts. If assembling with the M6x10 hex screw, print the two drilling jigs and cut
or file the screw’s remaining length from the end of the jig. File and taper the screw’s end, then
using the guide hole, drill a hole through the screw’s head. If using the plastic Pin, insert the roll
pin into the hole at the top of the Pin and press in to reinforce the plastic Pin. Insert the Pin into
the cheek rest. Position the lever over the guiding slot, and push the two 12mm roll pins in from
either side. Glue roll pins if loose. Insert spring into cheek rest, then place Base cup side
towards the spring on the spring. Compress with vise or c clamp until flush with cheek rest.
Insert 20mm roll pin. Test functionality and range of motion. Note you will need to push down
hard on the lever to get the pin to drop far enough to insert over the end of a buffer tube. This is
as designed. Apply glue to the inside of Brace. Insert cheek rest into the T-shaped hole on the
brace. Let sit for 15 minutes before finishing operations. Weave velcro or other strapping
material into the brace to satisfy the dog killers (or not, I’m not your mom).

## Small parts, lever, pin, and base:
E-sun PLA 235, supports from build plate. Print the pin wide side down, the base on the flat
side, and the lever on the long flat bottom. Generate support from build plate 100% infill.

## Jig:
Print impression facing up. Any material will work, just make sure you have thick walls. 50% or
greater infil is prefered.

## Cheek Rest:
E-sun PLA @235 50% infill. Print with the back of the tube touching the plate, and use supports
for touching build plate only. The only part that needs support is the T section.

## Brace:
TPU (i used 190 deg C) 50% infill. Print laying on the butt side to the plate, the slot opening to
the top. Print with support on, from everywhere, but can be printed without support with some
loss of quality.

## Legal Notices:
This is published with the full intention for it to be used as it was designed as an arm brace. To
match this intent you need to include the strap which is there for the purpose of tightly attaching
to the forearm. Also critical to the intent of this brace is printing the correct parts in TPU and not
in any other hard material. I’m not responsible for your puppers if you decide to print the brace
in hard plastics.
