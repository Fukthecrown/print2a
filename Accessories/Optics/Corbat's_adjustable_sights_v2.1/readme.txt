Iron sight pack made by corbat76 on keybase


Parts you will need to complete the sights:

4x M5X30 screws
5X M5 nuts
1x M5x25 screw (a spare can be found if you bought an Ender 3 just remove the washer) 
small flathead screwdriver

Optional:

Drill
Xacto knife
Sandpaper 


Tips:

1. Print everything in the orientation from the STLs. EXEPT the rear sight housings, they can be printed lying down to reduce support material and increase strength.
2. Print front sights, front sight posts, and rear sights with a .12 layer height because threading needs a higher resolution.
3. Use supports touching the buildplate. 
4. The front sights need supports everywhere with an overhang angle of 80 degrees.
5. Use a small screwdriver to screw in the front sight post with the elevation knob in place. 
6. If shits tight, keep screwing it until its loose. (You should be able to adjust the front sight post with your fingers)

I used PLA+ but you can use whatever you want.
