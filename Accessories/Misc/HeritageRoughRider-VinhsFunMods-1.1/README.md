# HeritageRoughRider-VinhsFunMods
Some fun toy goodies for decking out your Heritage Rough Rider. This repo only contains released STLs, IGSs, STEPs, and Fusion 360 archives.

## Instructions
For the grip piece **the one with the buffer tube adapter only**, you will need an M5 Nut and an M5 x 20mm socket head cap screw to tighten it to the gun. After printing your part, remove the existing grips from your gun. Slip the top part of the grip so it's tangent with the receiver- pivot it so that the trigger bar at the bottom of the grip slides into the grip. Push the grip (you will hear a pop probably) until the inner grip is as flush with the receiver as much as possible. Insert the n u t t into the divet on the right of the grip, and drive the screw through the hole on the left of the grip. Tighten as needed.

For the fore end pieces, there is some rough handling required. After printing the base fore-end piece, remove the ejector rod, spring, housing, and screw from the barrel. Set it aside for now. _With the cylinder and cylinder rod inserted into the firearm_, place the fore-end base sleeve over the barrel. Set the ejector rod and spring inside the base. Now, align and set (but don't push it just yet- it will be very difficult) the cylinder rod so it lines up with the corresponding hole in the base piece. Next, you will **ram the base piece so that the cylinder rod goes deeper into the fore-end**, up until the face of the foreend meets the receiver. This uses the teeth of the cylinder rod to seat and hold it inside the fore-end base, as well as against the receiver. Now tug on the fore-end piece so it is no longer binding to the receiver, and screw in the ejector housing screw into the fore-end. When you print the extension piece and cap, you will need to gently tap it into the tabs, as well. 

If you are print the grip piece (solo), you will need an M5 Nut and an M5 x 20mm socket head cap screw.
