##OVERVIEW
The Gunfighter Project is not a single definite item. It refers to a series of 3D printable accessories that would aid the user in a gunfight or tatical range. Thus, there is no end to the project: it would continue to grow and grow as long as there is a demand for certain items or innovations that a user can 3D print or obtain. The focus of the project is any item not defined as a firearm that when printed, would substantially aid the user in meeting the tatical demands of a gunfight. This includes pouches, belt attachments, dump pouches, anything in molle or attachable to backpacks.

####AR-15 MAGAZINE POUCH
When used, this device will give the user the ability to store magazines on a belt or clipped onto a shooter's body. The purpose is to enable the user to retain magazines and be able to reach for magazines on the go when needed.

##PRINT SETTINGS
Before slapping pieces onto the bed, you should ask yourself what mounting solution you want out of the pouch. If you are trying to attach the mag pouch to a belt, then print 2 pieces of the AF-GFP-AR15MP-PRT-002, and 4 pieces of the AF-GFP-AR15MP-PRT-003. If you are trying to mount the mag pouch like a clip to certain items, then print 2 pieces of the AF-GFP-AR15MP-PRT-004 and 2 pieces of the AF-GFP-AR15MP-PRT-003.


####ORIENTATION

When loading the STL of the item, the item will already be in the correct orientation as intended. Yes the magazine pouch is printed upside-down. And yes, despite what it seems like, it does not require supports! All other pieces should be printed in the same fashion.

##ASSEMBLY
The assembly is very simple. Apply the plates onto the magazine pouch, and fasten them using the bolts you have printed. Its very straight forward. If you need more force to fasten the bolts, use pliers or a slotted screwdriver.

---
##MAINTAINANCE
The items are built in PLA / PLA+ . Warping due to heat or sunlight will occur, so keep that in mind, as over time the magazines may be harders to fit into the pouch. If this occurs, replace the pouch.
