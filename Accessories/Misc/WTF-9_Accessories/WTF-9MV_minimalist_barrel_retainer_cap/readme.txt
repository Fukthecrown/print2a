* NOTE: The mag-holder foregrip model does not have a hole for a set-screw. However, one method of adding a fastner
is to drill a 2.5mm hole from the top side of the grip, and to install a 3mm sheet metal screw from inside the mag well of
the grip. That way, the fastner is hidden and can be tightened or loosened with a screwdriver from inside the grip.
