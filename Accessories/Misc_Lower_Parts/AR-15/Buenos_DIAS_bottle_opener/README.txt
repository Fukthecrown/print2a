# Summary

*Drop in* your purse, pocket or *auto* glove box, so you're never without the means to open a bottle!  Don't *sear* the food you're cooking while fumbling around for a bottle opener.  I took three classes in cooking.  By the time I got to *Class 3*, I realized how important a bottle opener is to a chef.  *Don't get caught* without one!

Presented with and without keyring hole, and with and without text.  Guaranteed to work very well for its intended purpose.  *Compatible with America's most popular carbonated beverage.*

Dedicated to the public domain.  *Please distribute throughout the world, so that no one will ever be without a bottle opener again!*  This is my gift to humanity.

Huge thanks to my dear friend Bob Lasnik, who inspired me to get into 3D printing.  Thanks, Bob!
