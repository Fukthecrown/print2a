Testing Coordinated by Incarbonite

Thanks to the FFLs who aided in the testing and development of this device.

Print both pieces in PLA+. 230C hotend, 50C bed, 100% infill.

Installation:

1. Install the body in place of the backplate on the slide.

2. Insert the sear tip into the body just enough to install a 2.5mmx18mm bolt through the slot.

3. Then with the trigger depressed and the slide in the forward position (before the trigger is reset), slide the sear tip forward just until it releases the sear. 

4. Tighten the bolt down with the sear tip in position. 

5…And its off to the races.
