This is the "Moms Demand Full Auto" 3D-Printable Swift Link - an educational model for understanding how swift links work - in particular, how a 3D printed swift link would work.

#### Works with
* Standard AR FCG 

* Most AR lowers

* Full Auto BCG (most AR15s have this, PSA, Daniel Defense, BCM, BCA).  Some commerial (Ruger, Colt) do not have the needed carrier.


#### Printing
* Print at 99% infill with support.  This works in PLA, but would work better in a more wear resistant poylmer like nylon. STL is oriented correctly for print orientation.
