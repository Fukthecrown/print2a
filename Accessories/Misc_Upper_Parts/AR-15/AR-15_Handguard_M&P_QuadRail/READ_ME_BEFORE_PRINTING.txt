These are missing the cut in groove at the bottom of each piece. Look at the original hand guard and notice the groove at the bottom to seat around the barrel nut.
I'm going to try and fix this in SolidWorks. This is just a heads up for anyone looking to print these for their M&P.

NOTICE: This is not my design and all credit goes to the original designer.
