## Intro 
This project is an inert firing pin intended for use to function test a 9mm Glock platform handgun. This firing pin will not discharge a bullet in the chamber, as there is no actual "pin" printed to it's tip. All double stack 9mm variants (Glock 17, 19, 25, 26, 34) should work. 

## Background
In certain states and localities, possession of an unregistered or unlicensed handgun is only illegal if said handgun is "operable" or "capable of discharging ammunition". New York State is one such state, all "Criminal Possession of a Weapon" statutes (unlicensed handgun possession/carry), have the following similar language in their Jury Instructions (https://www.nycourts.gov/judges/cji/2-PenalLaw/265/art265hp.shtml):

-For CRIMINAL POSSESSION OF A WEAPON IN THE FOURTH DEGREE (Possession of Firearm): "Under this count, the firearm need not be loaded but it must be operable. To be operable, a firearm must be capable of discharging ammunition."

-For CRIMINAL POSSESSION OF A WEAPON IN THE SECOND DEGREE (Possession of Loaded Firearm Not in Home or Business): "Under this count, the firearm must be loaded and operable. To be operable, a firearm must be capable of discharging ammunition."

## Value
1. An individual residing in one of these states could build an 80 percent Glock or 3D Print a Glock and dry fire/function test it to verify that it would work without breaking any local laws. This would be a great training pistol for dry firing since the trigger pull is extremely close to the real deal. They could store a real firing pin for use out-of-state if they so chose.
2. An individual traveling to one of these states could leave their firing pin behind in the last legal state they can legally possess a handgun, shielding them from local laws while still being able to protect themselves where they can. They could also ship their firing pin to their next location in a free state.
3. An individual moving to one of these states could switch this firing pin into their handgun and store it in their new state of residence without breaking any local laws.

## Usage
Once the part is printed, disassemble your Glock striker assembly. Remove your existing firing pin and swap in the inert firing pin. With the recommended print settings I was able to dry fire a Glock 130 times before the pin broke. If your pin breaks, what will happen is that your trigger refuses to reset. Once this occurs, remove the slide from your Glock frame, more than likely the cross shaped piece of the pin will have snapped off of the rod that travels through the channel. From here you can remove your Glock striker assembly as normal, you may need to use a small needle or toothpick and feed it down the firing pin channel from the front to push the rest of the snapped firing pin out. 

## Suggested Possible Modifications
1. Reinforcements via a nail in the base of the pin or other method is the big one. 130 function tests is pretty good for a 2g piece of Esun PLA+, but I'd like to see this capable enough to be used for extended dry-firing sessions.
