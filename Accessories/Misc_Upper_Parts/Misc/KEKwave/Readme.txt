Beta testing help: Sparky8899
Buffer hole model and all around saint: Mussy


This is a clone of the popular KAK Shockwave 2.0 Brace
It fits on a standard buffer tube and is adjustable in length of pull.

Im testing in standard PLA but nicer materials would probably increase its life.

4mm x 12mm screw

4mm nut


Optional:


Make lock tab out of 1/8" steel plate (~3.1mm, 3mm might work fine)
