#### Description
This contains a universal 12 gauge follower based on my original Mossberg followers. This design has been tested in a remington 870, mossberg 500, and winchester 1200, but should fit in any modern tube fed shotgun. The follower is designed slightly longer than OEM followers to prevent binding without reducing mag capacity. Additionally it features a hole in the top to both make removal of supports easier and provide a tactile indicator of an empty tube for low light scenarios.

#### What you'll need:

* PLA or PETG. I've tested in both, but I use PETG as in my (unscientific) testing it holds up to gun oils and solvents while PLA can begin to break down.
* A printer capable of printing PLA or PETG. I used the Ender 3.

#### Print Settings

##### Orientation
Print standing with the opening for the spring facing the print bed.

##### Temperature, Layer Height, and Supports
* Nozzle Temp: You Decide!
* Bed Temp: You Decide!
* No Brim
* Supports: tree preferred, but any works
* Layer height: 0.12mm - 0.32mm tested
* Shells (aka perimeters): 10 inner/outer (the real number of perimeters is lower, but this ensures no infill) 
* Bed prep: Gluestick or painters tape if necessary
* Ironing (optional): For a smoother top finish, turn on Cura's ironing function and set it to concentric.

##### Installation
1. Remove barrel by unscrewing the cap at the end of your mag tube and moving the forend to about a half cocked position
2. Remove the magazine tube by unscrewing it.
3. Replace safety by placing it in the receiver.
4. When rescrewing your magazine tube into place, it helps to push the follower into the magazine tube with your other hand.
5. Reinstall barrel and rescrew endcap.

##### Troubleshooting
* Occasionally, an overextrusion along the followers outer wall will prevent it from entering the tube. Trim these off with a sharp blade.
* Old versions of this follower may have required slight sanding to fit if your printer isn't perfectly calibrated. This version should remedy that, but you may still need light sanding if you're way out of spec.
