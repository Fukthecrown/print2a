Changelog:
4/4/20: Modified my FGC KW tube and Brace to fit the AP9 (2020) 
-Changed internal dimensions to match AP9
-Moved top mounting hole up 1mm to align with Upper Receiver Hole

This is a modified clone of the popular KAK Shockwave 2.0 Brace but for the AP9 (2020)
It fits on the inculded modifed AP9 buffer tube and has an adjustable in length of pull.

Im testing in standard PLA/+ but nicer materials would probably increase its life.

If you can source a spring that would work the best, but a notch was made on adjustment lever that allows you to wrap brace has
with a rubber band and with testing that has shown to also work well.

Parts:

1/8"x 15/16" Spring (~3mm x ~24mm) Or Rubber band

5mm x 15mm screw

5mm nut
