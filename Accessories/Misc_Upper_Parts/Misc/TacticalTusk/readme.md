CTRLPew & Deterrence Dispersed Presents
The Tactical Tusk
A 3D printable, picatinny or NVG mountable Narwhal Tusk Spike Bayonet with a detatchable and replacable tip.

On November 29th 2019 a terrorist attack claimed the lives of two individuals on London bridge. Darryn Frost was nearby attending a prisoner rehabilitation event when the attack started. 

"I took a narwhal tusk from the wall and used it to defend myself and others from the attacker." - Frost

A reminder that good men should never be forced into an inferior position by the laws of a nation, and those same men will sacrafice themselves for their neighbors in the face of evil.
