<Experimental process>

á@
Temporarily stop 3D printing when the height of the model you are printing reaches 15mm

áA
Insert a metal reinforcing plate processed by a milling machine
(If support material is formed inside, insert metal reinforcing plate after removal)

áB
Resume 3D printing

<Enhancement advice>

á@
Design ingenuity
When designing a reinforced rifle receiver, a shape that does not use support materials is best
You can easily insert metal reinforcement plate

áA
Use adhesive
Applying a fast drying adhesive to the place where the metal reinforcing plate is to be inserted will fill
the gaps and increase the strength
Resumes paused 3D printing after drying

áB
Annealing processing
3D printed material does not have uniform molecular alignment direction
If this is annealed, the molecules will align and crystallize, increasing the strength
For example, PLA can align molecules by heating at 100 Åã for about 20 minutes
A home oven or electric kettle can be used for heating
If you are concerned about shape changes due to annealing,
it is effective to insert a pin into the hole first and a block into the groove

<Precautions when designing>

á@
Make a small hole in the area where the metal reinforcement plate is inserted
to reach the outside of the model
Without this hole, 3D CAD would not consider the model as a single part
