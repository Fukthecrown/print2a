Printing: print all parts at 100% infill, with supports. 

Assembly: Magazine requires half of a standard 30-round spring to function. The follower and spring guide are modeled directly off a Bulgarian polymer magazine,
but any  5.45 spring should work. You do not have to use the included notches to retain the spring to the follower/guide, but they are included for your convenience.
Use any superglue to affix the follower roof to the follower, these were designed as separate parts to improve print quality.

NOTE: Autodesk .ipt files can be opened and edited in solidworks, solidworks will need to convert them first.
