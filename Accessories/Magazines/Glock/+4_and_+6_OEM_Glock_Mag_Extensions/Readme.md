#### Descriptions 
These files contain the design for a 3D printed glock magaziene extension. This design requires an M4 screw to lock the extension on the magazine. Any M4 screw will work given sufficient length 5mm. Personally I like the grub screw.

##### Features
Dramatically curved body to allow for easy finger grabbyness, expediting the recharging of your freedom dispenser. Utilizes all the parts from the OEM mag except the floorplate.
Additional Vairants and styles coming soon.

####Print Instructions
Walls:5
Ceeling:5
Floor:5
Infill: 60%

#### Installation Instructions
Pick your body and print it vertically (locking lips up) with supports everywhere. Once printed dissasemble your OEM magazine. Drop the locking plate, nipple up, into the extension. With the spring and follower assembled and insetred into the OEM mag body; insert the spring into the extension(Render/3) and seat the locking interface in the rear half of the extension. Slide the magazine body forward to seat it and tighten down the M4 screw. (This screw should not go all the way in. Thats by design. The body of the screw is what locks the extension on to the magazine) 

** Some beta testers have reported needing to stretch their magazine spring slightly to accomodate this.
