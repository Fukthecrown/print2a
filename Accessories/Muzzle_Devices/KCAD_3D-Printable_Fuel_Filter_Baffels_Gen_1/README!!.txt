Following your local laws is recommended. 

WARNING! Building and shooting with your own suppressors can be dangerous, use these files at your own risk.
Failure to read all instructions could result in personal injury.

Baffle Size Selection:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The baffle you need will depend on the fuel filter you are going to use for the project, as well as the bullet you intend to shoot.
Start with finding the right size baffle:

-The 1.8 inch diameter by 1.8 inch high baffles work for the NAPA 4003 fuel filter as well as the WIX 24744 heavy duty fuel filter. 
However, these fuel filters will need thread adapters for use. 

-The 1.77 inch diameter by 1.624 inch high baffles work for several fuel filters found on many popular online websites. Look for the 
ID (inner diameter) in the fuel filter's description. Often the names NAPA 4003 or WIX 24003 will be in the descriptions as well.

-The 1.75 inch diameter by 1.6 inch high baffles work for the Konduone FBA 10032021 1/2"-28 fuel filter, as well as several other filters 
found on many popular online websites. Look for the ID (inner diameter) in the fuel filter's description.  Often the names NAPA 4003 
or WIX 24003 will be in the descriptions as well.


WARNING! These fuel filters cannot handle the pressures of supersonic 223 or more powerful loads. However, they can handle all subsonic
ammunition (All calibers), as well as all handgun ammo (supersonic and subsonic).


Baffle Bore Caliber selection:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every size baffle will have multiple Bore calibers to choose from. Choose a Bore caliber that is larger than the largest caliber bullet you 
intend to shoot through it. Or if you have a bullet caliber like a 243 caliber bullet, you can use a 23 caliber bore baffle (or larger bore 
caliber) and drill the bore of the baffle to at least 26 caliber. The bore caliber size of the baffle is a personal preference. The
tighter the bullet is to the bore of the baffle, the more of an effect the suppressor will have. However, the larger the distance is 
between the bullet and the bore of the baffle, the higher the safety margin. As a reference, an industrial standard suppressor bore size 
table has been included in the attached files.


Note: Five baffles fit in a single fuel filter. Its recommended (but not required) to use PLA+ or stronger filaments for 9mm and more 
powerful calibers. USE 100% INFILL.


Printing Instructions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The baffles must be printed with the support skirt facing down so that all sides are touching the printing bed. The recommended printer 
nozzle temperature is 235 celsius. 


Prepping the Baffle for Installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once the correct baffle has been printed, remove the support skirt around the baffle where it contacts the body, making sure to not damage 
the four pillars. Filing and/or sanding may be required after skirt removal so the outside of the baffle is smooth. Next you will have to 
drill through the inside of the baffle to the correct caliber size you are comfortable with. Make sure that there is no debris inside the 
baffle after drilling. 


Installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation is pretty self explanatory, make sure the top of the cone on the inside of the baffle faces the side of the suppressor that 
screws on to the muzzle of the firearm.
