>Description
This is the CAD needed to use electrochemical machining to craft 9x19 barrels from off-the-shelf 16mm-OD, 8mm-ID hardened chrome alloy steel tubes.

>IMPORTANT NOTE<
If your barrel doesn't fit into the standard fixture, you may have to either sand/fit your fixture to the barrel, or print one of the oversized fixtures.  Different slicers and printers have a variance of ~1mm on the size of the diameter of the pocket for the barrel for whatever reason.


>Print Directions<

You must use a .4mm or smaller nozzle for the rifling mandrel.
Included in the renders folder is an image of how the rifling mandrel should look when sliced in your slicer - the insulated section at the bottom must be present.

* Material: eSun PLA+ (or any PLA)
* Print Temp: 230 C
* Bed Temp: 60 C
* Bed Prep: Wipe clean, apply a layer of Elmer’s glue stick.
* Infill: 100%, Rectilinear Fill
* Enclosure: None
* Orientation: STLs are properly oriented.  I don't reccomend you change the orientations.
* Supports: From bed on the Fixture, from bed on the Rifling Mandrel, none on the End Pilot, none on the Chambering Tool Insulator.

An important note about the rifling mandrel and chamberign tool insulator.
Because they are tall and print upright, I reccomend you either run your fan at 60% for the duration of the print, or bump your print speed down.
Your PLA might not have time to properly cool, which will ruin your mandrel or insulator before the print finishes.
