For those who want to grab some of the items on the shopping list a bit quicker (without having to wait for China shipping):

Pump: https://www.amazon.com/bayite-Diaphragm-Priming-Pressure-Adjustable/dp/B074MZYS37
Tubing: https://www.amazon.com/ID-OD-Vinyl-Tubing-Approved/dp/B01LWSPRCG

Fittings: https://www.amazon.com/Anderson-Metals-Brass-Fitting-Connector/dp/B003RVV6IO

I'll leave you to your own sources for the other items on the list, as they are something you probably already have, or can find easily online or in-store.

The barrel stock must still be bought from China, as they are the critical part in question for this testing.
